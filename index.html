              Something you should know about me is that I’ve developed a keen eye for dysfunction. If you’re old enough to remember the Modest Mouse album “Good News for People Who Love Bad News,” that title really spoke to me and has served as a mantra for my sense of ironic detachment.

              .. which is lucky, because most places I’ve worked have had more bad news than good news. <br /><br />Of course there’s selection bias at the root of that. I was hired into those places because they had problems, and they wanted my help with those problems. And sometimes I take jobs because I think they’ll turn out to be a rich vein of funny stories.

              I’m pretty good at judging that, so I am not complaining. And since I was in a position of responsibility at these places I’ll add that hopefully, I did more good than harm.<br /><br />I’m going to talk through some such stories. My hope with this is to do more good than harm. <br /><br />Maybe y’all can create more fulfilling places to work, and hire me to work there.<br />

              One big problem everywhere is that once you have two employees, you have to divide responsibility somehow.<br /><br />How you do this is massively important. It’s a move with both immediate and second-order consequences which are mostly awful to contemplate.<br /><br />So most companies are relatively thoughtless about it.

              Computer scientists like me start their career by realizing that they accidentally joined a math major that isn’t a science, and isn’t about computers. It’s about how abstract work gets done and stuff.<br /><br />And the trauma of this initial realization is so severe that we spend our entire careers refusing to apply anything we learned outside the domain of computers. <br /><br />Things might be better if we tried to think about work analytically. Later in this talk I will try, despite how much it hurts me to do so.

              You’d think this would be a really scrappy situation but no, at that point they had already managed to try to set themselves up like IBM in the 1970s or something.<br /><br />I was hired to work on a python middle layer which should not have existed in the first place. In a misguided attempt at scaling, they added a Python middle layer. The theory was that web requests would be served faster if they progressed through more network hops. <br /><br />This is a weird theory that I don’t get but people keep trying it. It is incidentally, the software-architectural version of the mistakes companies make throughout this talk. (But those of you familiar with Conway would find this observation trite.)

              So to launch any feature at this company,<br />You needed to get a database person to do some DDL and write some stored procedures.<br />You needed to get a python person to write some python that achieved very little.<br />You needed a PHP person to write some frontend code.<br />You needed either a JS or Flash person to make the user interface sizzle. <br />As a result of all of this, the company released approximately zero features for two whole years and everyone got fired. <br />(But not me, I survived by complaining.

              They’d managed to avoid serializing absolutely everything, in that they’d divided into feature teams. And they had shared services teams like ops, and DBA’s, and so on. That seemed reasonable at first, or at least not different than most places.<br />

              But something interesting had happened where they just kept dividing, like a bacteria colony out of control or something. <br />For example they split engineering management in half and created a role called “release manager.” To … manage releases, I guess? It was never entirely clear to me why.<br />

              And they chased that dragon pretty far unfortunately, into some very dark corners. <br /><br />A big mistake they made in my view was that they conflated roles with work a little too much. Frontend engineers did all of the frontend work and none of the backend work, and vice versa. <br /><br />That might be survivable, but taking that policy to the security team and making them do all of the security work was not. I’ll come back to this.

              The product portfolio as a whole had a very weak supervisory structure.<br />They didn’t coordinate in any meaningful way on tech stacks or other shared decisions, since they all independently reported up to a CEO that made no attempt to coordinate them.<br />But despite that, an attempt was made at having a shared operations function.<br />This presented a lot of difficulty because the operations function wasn’t adequately involved in architecture decisions, which were largely left to individual engineers.<br />They wouldn’t have had enough time to do that anyway, since they were busy with hundreds of services that dev teams may have moved on from years before.<br />The end result of this was that everyone was overworked, and the quality of service was more or less unknown.<br />It’s a tale as old as time, really.

              I think a lot of people notice this and chafe at it when the role is for the new hotness. For example, every company wants to rub some AI on their stuff now, so they are putting up job descriptions for an AI engineer. <br /><br />If you’re an engineer interested in AI sitting in such a company, you’re annoyed that they’re doing this (and potentially paying that person more than you) when you could easily rub some AI on some stuff.<br /><br />This is just a salient example of a dumb mistake that happens in many, many more dimensions all the time.

              Now that’s despite every single one of those companies claiming that they quote-unquote “do devops.” <br /><br />Devops as a portmanteau was meant to communicate something about breaking down the divide, and building empathy between these two groups.

              Once people have subdivided work, they naturally try to arrange people into assembly lines of the mind. <br /><br />If you have AI work, hand it over to the AI person. If you have ops work, give it to the ops person.<br /><br />That’s the kind of thing that feels obvious to leaders, but I think it’s wrong. And sometimes it’s wrong in a mathematically provable way. Let’s dig in.

              Whoops! We made everything go slower, actually. <br /><br />With that simple setup, it doesn’t take very long at all for things to get extremely out of hand. We added a few engineers and wound up with a nonlinear increase in how long people need to wait before they can ship things. <br /><br />By the time the data scientists are fully busy, the individual feature waiting for analysis is absolutely doomed. <br /><br />(You can play with the variables <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OIoTVnOmSPpWAnu5QCwvf7bjNjPKWfnZQ3RjQ4hoQG0/edit?gid=0#gid=0">here</a>.)

              Of course, organizational dynamics are stacked against analyzing this problem in a clearheaded way. Everyone thinks the other sides are being foolish. At the margins, we come into petty conflicts that obscure the physics of the situation further. <br /><br />The data scientists might say the engineering team didn’t phrase their request properly. The engineers think the data scientists are too obsessed with rigor. There are ways in which they are both right but this is all the symptom of a deeper issue.

              That kind of setup is one in which ticketing things can generate more work than a quick conversation. That’s a specific case of a general issue, which is that poorly factored organizational boundaries generate work that wouldn’t otherwise exist. <br />

              An easy example with which to understand this was at the company I talked about earlier, that tried to use its security team to do all of the security remediation work.<br /><br />By adding a queue for security tickets and workers to serve them, they were hoping for a result like this. There’d be the same total volume of work getting through the system, and fewer context switches.<br />

              We can generate extra security work with our engineering activity if we erect a wall between them.<br /><br />If you take my queueing analogies too seriously you might expect your overall development throughput to slow down, since the security queue can’t keep up. But in practice this mostly doesn’t happen. The weak point in this setup is the collective will to do security work, so it just doesn’t get done. The security queue overflows and explodes. <br /><br />On a long enough timescale of course something horrible precipitates, but that’s a problem for future you. In the here and now it’s only a minor humanitarian catastrophe which we can ignore.

              Although the results of these tendencies are very stupid, punting the offenders into the sun usually eludes us a solution. That’s because this behavior can be coded as “smart” and “valuable” to outside observers. <br /><br />A CEO may not endorse the behavior, but they imagine that it gets results. Except it doesn’t. Driving other workers out reduces total throughput. I can’t believe I have to say that. <br /><br />The biggest problem with brilliant jerks is not necessarily even that they’re jerks. When taking a systemic perspective, they aren’t even brilliant! They’re dumb!

              Recurring themes throughout every chapter of this for me are parochialism and ego, the yin and yang of dysfunction.<br />Both have their positive and negative spins: parochialism might be excess deference, and not wanting to step on someone else’s toes. Or it might be lack of curiosity.<br />Ego might be pride in your work, or it might be dismissiveness in the abilities of others.<br />These are the instincts that lead to the breakdowns in empathy that fill our lives with pain.

              The startup I worked at fought its way from horizontally layered fiefdoms to a simpler architecture and a simpler, smaller team.  <br />We imported some leaders that took devops very seriously, as they had come up with the idea in the first place.<br />The most important bit that we took from that movement was that we should tear down existing barriers between roles. So after about two years of creative destruction pretty much everybody was pitching in on pretty much everything. <br />

              But it’s a lot less common in my experience to buy into that model for other disciplines. <br />We had a word for the idea that SRE and developers should share tasks, it was “devops.” But like I said nearly all teams I’ve worked on since have not actually done this. <br />And many teams I’ve worked on have also failed to extrapolate, and have had frontend or client engineers strictly siloed from backend engineers. <br />Sometimes they’ve built entire GraphQL monstrosities to avoid talking to each other. <br />You want someone that’s an expert in frontend work, but I think you probably do not want people with “frontend” and “backend” in their title.

              That we needed to give people slack time like that to sustain the level of overall teamwork was a general principle. <br /><br />There were other ways in which we didn’t just wait for the streams to cross themselves. We injected sustaining energy into this system very intentionally.

              Human beings are limited by their in-group. <br />You feel psychological safety within your in group.<br />You feel like you can experiment and learn new things within your in group.<br />You can exercise curiosity about the people in your in-group and what they do. <br />We invested time in making people’s in-groups larger. <br />Bootcamps were one of those ways: we forced people to work on other teams occasionally. <br />Hack weeks were another institution that achieved similar ends.<br />These things sound like wastes of time to most CEO’s I’ve worked for, but this is shortsighted.

              A decade later, I can articulate what our organization’s principles were. I can explain the higher-level reasons we were doing bootcamps, or code reviews, or a million other things. This is a victory of being intentional and vocal about what our team values were.<br />

              It was important to us to articulate that elitism as an attitude was poison. To the contrary, we do windows here. If a ditch needs digging, our tech leads will line up to dig it. <br /><br />We also needed to create the strong expectation that you’d leave things in a better state as you messed with other people’s stuff. That made people overjoyed to have you messing with their stuff.

              Inside and outside of tech the world is rife with cult leaders who lack the gene for humility - bullies who inspire and encourage cruelty in their followers to no end other nihilism. <br /><br />At a certain genetic equilibrium NPD is evolutionarily adaptive. In tech we’ve grown a tendency to reward what the Germans call the Klugscheißer, literally, the “smart shitter.” The industry believes in assholes.<br /><br />Valuing others around you should not be a radical act, but that’s where things are unfortunately.

              I’ve tried. Let me give you some notes about trying.<br /><br />Yes, growth hacking is a bad word and everything. But I have started growth teams twice and the one weird trick to making marketing start to work is to … try to help? It’s crazy. <br /><br />I inherited a situation where SRE was doing all of the deploys for the company, like it was the 90s. I pushed to switch that to developers shipping their own code. There was some hesitation, the worry being that developers would break stuff and not fix it. But the better angels of our nature prevailed, engineers largely resolved their own incidents right away. Product engineers actually asked to be handed the pagers! It was heartwarming. <br />

              A thing that has been a missing ingredient in situations like those was permission. Mainly what I needed to do was give people the permission they needed to be curious, and to cooperate. <br /><br />I don’t think you can grass roots this stuff, beyond what I’m trying to do here by making the idea popular. <br /><br />It’s on us as leaders to value cooperation and to reward curiosity.<br /><br />Parochialism and ego need the investment of active energy to be destroyed

              In addition to permission, there has to be slack in the system. This requires persistent commitment. <br />When you start skipping the bootcamps, they’ll die out as a practice. <br />If you recall my diversions into Kingman’s formula earlier in the talk, in some situations we can prove mathematically that slack in the system is necessary.<br />We don’t let our machines run at 100% utilization. But again, we have a tendency to love our computers more than ourselves.

              The things we value and reward as leaders trickle down. Leaders can reward our worst or our best impulses. <br />If your leader thinks the worst of us is what’s necessary, push back if you can. Not everyone can!

              In the industry zeitgeist, devops went through the “this is a thing we need, so it’s a role” arc and you eventually saw job listings for devops engineers. Then eventually it was a tool you were buying, and the tool would let you rub some devops on things. Then it went out of fashion.<br />But the entire idea was that the roles should exist with a blurry line of responsibility.<br />This was just two friends of mine from Flickr standing on stage saying: “hey I’m John, hey I’m Paul, we are friends and cooperate.”<br />Working at a high-functioning engineering organization just meant just taking this extremely seriously, initially between dev and ops.<br />But eventually we took that premise seriously in an omni-directional sort of way and that’s where the magic came from.

              That was 15 years ago now, which was long enough in the past that they used square slides. <br />Most places I’ve worked were improved by taking the spirit of DevOps seriously, and in my opinion they could have used more of it.<br />The industry as a whole would be improved by the same.
