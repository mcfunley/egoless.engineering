              Of course immediately once you have two employees, you have to divide responsibility somehow<br />But how you effect this is massively important<br />It’s a move with both immediate and second-order consequences<br />Most companies are relatively thoughtless about it

              The product portfolio as a whole had a very weak supervisory structure.<br />They didn’t coordinate in any meaningful way on tech stacks or other shared decisions, since they all independently reported up to a CEO that made no attempt to coordinate them.<br />But despite that, an attempt was made at having a shared operations function.<br />This presented a lot of difficulty because the operations function wasn’t adequately involved in architecture decisions, which were largely left to individual engineers.<br />They wouldn’t have had enough time to do that anyway, since they were busy with hundreds of services that dev teams may have moved on from years before.<br />The end result of this was that everyone was overworked, and the quality of service was more or less unknown.<br />It’s a tale as old as time.

              Easy example with which to understand this was at the company I talked about earlier, that tried to use its security team to do all of the security remediation work.<br /><br />By adding a queue for security tickets and workers to serve them, they were hoping for a result like this. There’d be the same total volume of work getting through the system, and fewer context switches for the development queue.

              The problem is what development can get up to when they aren’t encouraged to be paranoid about security.<br /><br />Compare:<br />Security team scrambling to keep up with bugs in a regex-driven sql rewriting framework, vs.<br />not doing anything remotely like this<br />If the framing of your security team is that engineers don’t need to worry about security, this is what inevitably happens

              So you wind up generating a lot of extra security work with your engineering activity, after erecting a wall between them.<br /><br />If you take the queueing analogies too seriously you might expect your overall development throughput to slow down, since the security queue can’t keep up. But in practice this mostly doesn’t happen. The weak point in this setup is the collective will to do security work, so it just doesn’t get done. The security queue overflows and explodes. <br /><br />On a long enough timescale of course something horrible precipitates, but that’s a problem for future you. In the here and now it’s only a minor humanitarian catastrophe which we can ignore.

In tech we’ve grown a tendency to reward what the Germans call the Klugscheißer, literally, the “smart shitter.” The industry believes in assholes.<br /><br />Valuing others around you should not be a radical act, but that’s where things are.

              It shouldn’t be radical because results are better if we can cooperate, and life is better without cult leaders. <br /><br />How do we tear down parochialism and ego?

              Yes, growth hacking is a bad word and everything. But I have started growth teams twice and the one weird trick to making marketing start to work is to … try to help? It’s crazy. <br /><br />I inherited a situation where SRE was doing all of the deploys for the company, truly partying like it was 1999. I pushed to switch that to developers shipping their own code. There was some hesitation, the worry being that developers would break stuff and not fix it. But the better angels of our nature prevailed, engineers largely resolved their own incidents right away. Product engineers actually asked to be handed the pagers! It was heartwarming. <br />

              Why don’t more people try this? What do people need to do it?<br /><br />I don’t think you can grass roots it, beyond what I’m trying to do here by making the idea popular  <br />(Permission, it’s on us as leaders to spot this stuff)<br />People need permission to stray outside their expertise, and the psychological safety of knowing that mistakes made in the good faith effort to push forward aren’t sanctioned. <br />Rather, those are the opportunities to improve the resiliency of the collective effort.<br />Parochialism and ego need the investment of active energy to be destroyed

              In addition to permission, Slack in the system. Requires persistent commitment. Skip the bootcamps, it’ll die out<br />it’s worth it in terms of overall efficiency. Kingman’s formula<br />We don’t let our machines run at 100% utilization. But again, we love our computers more than ourselves

              In the industry zeitgeist, devops went through the “this is a thing we need, so it’s a role” arc and you eventually saw job listings for devops engineers. Then eventually it was a tool you were buying, and the tool would let you rub some devops on things. Then it went out of fashion.<br />But the entire idea was that the roles should exist with a blurry line of responsibility.<br />This was just two friends of mine from Flickr standing on stage saying: “hey I’m John, hey I’m Paul, we are friends and cooperate.”<br />Working at a high-functioning eng org. meant just taking this extremely seriously, initially between dev and ops.<br />But eventually we took that premise seriously in an omni-directional sort of way and that’s where the magic came from.

              That was 15 years ago now, which was long enough in the past that they used square slides. <br />Most places I’ve worked were improved by taking the spirit of DevOps seriously, and in my opinion they could have used more of it.<br />The industry as a whole would be improved by the same.
